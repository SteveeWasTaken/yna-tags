# yna-tags

Welcome to the YNA-Tags repository. In here, you will find some cool useful tags you can use for your Discord servers, with [42](https://42.rockett.space/).

### Bonus
The Manual has it's own GitHub repository! Find it [here](https://github.com/steveewastaken/yna-manual)
### Adding tags to your server
It's really simple.

1. Make sure you have a .yna file in your Desktop, or any folder, and that 42 is in the server you want to add the tag to.
2. In your server, type in `+tag create <your-tag-name>`, obviously replacing <your-tag-name> with the name you want to use for the tag.
3. Once 42 asks you for what you want to put in your tag, attach your .yna file to the chat, and don't send any text, just the .yna file.
4. Done! To use the tag, just run `+tag <your-tag-name>`.

### Deleting tags
If you added a tag you no longer want to use, or misspelled something, then you can delete the tag to try again.

1. All you have to do is run the command `+tag delete <your-tag-name>` and it's done.
