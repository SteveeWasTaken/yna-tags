# yna-tags

Welcome to the YNA-Tags repository. In here, you will find some cool useful tags you can use for your Discord servers, with [42](https://42.rockett.space/).

### Adding tags to your server
It's really simple.

1. Make sure you have a .yna file in your Desktop, or any folder, and that 42 is in the server you want to add the tag to.
2. In your server, type in `+tag create <your-tag-name>`, obviously replacing <your-tag-name> with the name you want to use for the tag.
3. Once 42 asks you for what you want to put in your tag, attach your .yna file to the chat, and don't send any text, just the .yna file.
4. Done! To use the tag, just run `+tag <your-tag-name>`.
